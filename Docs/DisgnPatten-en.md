**Design Pattern Choice:**

In the given scenario, we have employed the **Strategy Pattern** design pattern. The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each algorithm into a class, and making them interchangeable. In this context, two algorithm classes (`AlgorithmA` and `AlgorithmB`) were created to represent different strategies for calculating the final score. These algorithms can be dynamically switched, and they are encapsulated within the `ScoringAlgorithm` interface.

**Overview of the Strategy Pattern:**

The Strategy Pattern falls under the category of behavioral design patterns, enabling the definition of a family of algorithms, each encapsulated in a class, and providing interchangeability between them without affecting the client's use. In the Strategy Pattern, there is a context object (here, the `Student` class) that holds a reference to a strategy object (implementing the `ScoringAlgorithm` interface) and can dynamically switch between these strategies. This flexibility allows the choice of algorithms not to be determined at compile-time but rather at runtime.

**Common Approaches in the Strategy Pattern:**

1. **Context:** Holds a reference to a strategy object and invokes the strategy object's methods when needed.

2. **Strategy:** Defines an algorithm family, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable.

3. **ConcreteStrategy:** Implements the `Strategy` interface, representing specific algorithms.

**Relation of the Scenario to the Strategy Pattern:**

- **Context:** The `Student` class serves as the context object, holding a reference to the `ScoringAlgorithm` interface.

- **Strategy:** The `ScoringAlgorithm` interface acts as the strategy, defining the method for calculating the final score.

- **ConcreteStrategy:** `AlgorithmA` and `AlgorithmB` are concrete strategies, implementing the `ScoringAlgorithm` interface and representing distinct algorithms for score calculation.

**Why Use the Strategy Pattern:**

1. **Dynamic Algorithm Switching:** In this scenario, there is a requirement to dynamically switch between different algorithms at runtime. The Strategy Pattern allows this without modifying the context class.

2. **Extensibility:** The system should easily accommodate the addition of new algorithms without altering existing code. This aligns with the requirement of being able to add new score calculation algorithms with minimal modifications.

3. **Reduced Conditional Statements:** The Strategy Pattern reduces the need for extensive conditional statements by encapsulating different algorithms in separate classes, leading to clearer and more maintainable code.

The loose coupling between the context object (`Student` class) and the algorithms (`ScoringAlgorithm` interface and its implementations) in the Strategy Pattern enhances system flexibility and extensibility.
